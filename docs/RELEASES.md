Please add your comments and issues for the website as [issues](https://github.com/ML4MX/website/issues). 
Everyone is welcome to collaborate, so please fork the github repository and commit changes.

> **NOTE**: For the first online symposium of ML4MX, I do hope that the people involved 
in this forum encourage everyone to use both [github](https://github.com/) and any of the 
available Open Source Software tools in the Internet with the idea of allowing 
anyone to re-run and understand the code without any barriers.
