* As an example for pull request with a blogpost-submission, you can login to
your github and go to this [pull request](https://github.com/ML4MX/blogpost-submission/pull/3)
which is about "Why GitHub and how to use it?" then go to ```Files changes``` for
reviewing and then add your review(s) about the post as comment(s) in ```Conversation```.

* [arXiv repository](https://github.com/ML4MX/arXiv) has been created to submit
